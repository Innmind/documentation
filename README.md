# Innmind documentation

Most [packages](packages.md) you'll find in this organization are here to advance the organization [vision](vision.md). All of them are designed with the same [principles](design_choices.md) to simplify integration and context switching.

You can view the dependencies between the packages via this [macOS application](https://github.com/Innmind/macOS-tooling).

> **Note** However some are here to solve recurring problems you may find in a professional context, or for intellectual curiosity.
