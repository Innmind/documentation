# Crawler

This is the [underlying package](https://github.com/innmind/crawler/) of the [Crawler application](../applications/crawler.md).

You only have to specify the resource you want to crawl and it will automatically extract a bunch of attributes such as the title, the language, the main content, all the links and more. You can extend the default behaviour by adding your own [parser](https://github.com/Innmind/Crawler/blob/develop/src/Parser.php).
