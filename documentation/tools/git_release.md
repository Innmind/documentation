# Git release

A small [CLI tool](https://github.com/innmind/gitrelease/) to automatically find the new release number to tag when you want to release a major, minor or bugfix release. The tool only need you to specify a tag message and will find the release number and then push the branch and tag to the remote repository.

**Note**: it only works if you follow the [semver](https://semver.org).
