# Profiler

A framework agnostic [web app](https://github.com/innmind/profiler/) to log all the HTTP requests and CLI commands of your app. All communications are done through an HTTP API so it can be integrated in any project since it won't conflict with your dependencies.

If you already use some of the Innmind packages you may use [`debug`](https://github.com/innmind/debug/) to ease the communication with the profiler.
