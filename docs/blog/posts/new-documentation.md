# New documentation websites

This documentation website intends to guide you through the different packages of this ecosystem and how to start using them.

However, advance usage documentation of each package will still reside in their repositories. This helps keep the documentation up to date.

Historically these documentations were simple markdown files alongside the code. From now on they'll be available as a website thanks to [Material for MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

The following documentations are already available:

- [`innmind/framework`](https://innmind.github.io/framework/)
- [`innmind/operating-system`](https://innmind.github.io/OperatingSystem/)
- [`innmind/filesystem`](http://innmind.github.io/Filesystem/)
- [`innmind/immutable`](http://innmind.github.io/Immutable/)
- [`innmind/black-box`](https://innmind.github.io/BlackBox/)

More should come in the future.
