# Testing

Testing is an important part of any project. In PHP the popular frameworks helps you test at different levels of abstraction with a variety of syntaxes. But they all work pretty much the same way: they help you test one particular scenario.

    Innmind uses the [Property Based Testing](property-based-testing.md) technique.

This helps bring higher and higher stable abstractions without the burden to write more scenarii manually.

[`innmind/black-box`](blackbox.md) can help you bring this technique to your projects. You can start writing tests like you're used to and gradually move toward PBT.

Innmind packages started initially where tested with PHPUnit and gradually move to BlackBox.
