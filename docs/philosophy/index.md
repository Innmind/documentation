# Philosophy

The ultimate goal of this organization is to verify [Antonio Damasio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Damasio)'s theory of consciousness[^1].

While this objective doesn't directly matter for your projects it structures this ecosystem in a big way:

_Innmind itself tries to solve a problem._

This is why all the packages fits together to help solve bigger and bigger problems. It also means it won't go away while the goal is not reached. And since the goal may even be unreachable, Innmind is here to stay!

This also enforces 2 things. Abstractions need to be extremely robust to safely build higher abstractions. And they need to be reusable outside this project (to avoid being wasted in case the goal is not reachable).

All the following sections will describe the principles behind the abstractions robustness.
