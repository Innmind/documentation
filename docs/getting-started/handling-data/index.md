# Handling data

Handling data is an essential part of any program. Handling them simply and in a safe way can become difficult as a program becomes more complex.

In this chapter you'll find the 3 most used data structures throughout Innmind.

You'll learn how to them for simple cases and how they become indispensable as a program grows.
