# Vision

The ultimate goal of this organization is to verify [Antonio Damasio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Damasio)'s theory of consciousness.

Building each level of abstraction will become more and more complex. To keep the level of complexity manageable every [package](packages.md) follows the same [principles](design_choices.md), this means _reinventing the wheel_ even though a similar package already exists in the PHP ecosystem.

Since this goal may not be reachable, packages are designed in a way so that they can be used in any project.
